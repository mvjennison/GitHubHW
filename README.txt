My name is Madigan Jennison, and I am currently a biochemical undergraduate researcher in a materials science lab.

In my role there, I focus on the isolation of pDNA and proteins from benchtop bioreactor-based fermentation processes, as well as the chemical altering of this pDNA to develop precursor materials for drug delivery, gene production, and cellular scaffolding. I also aid in the creation of novel DNA crosslinkers to create and test various hydrogels. 

My primary research interets are in the immunological and virological fields, including the pathological basis of disease, as well as the integration of my current research into furthering the study and development of various biosensors.
